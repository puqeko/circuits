# Circuits

Idea for a way to quickly input circuit diagrams with only a keyboard. Made with Processing.

## To do
- Insert values for components.
- Align components upright (e.g. inductors and resistors) when in drawing mode.
- Add notes.
- Crop exported image so that circuit sits in screen center.
