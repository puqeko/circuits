# Circuits

Idea for a way to quickly input circuit diagrams with only a keyboard. Made with Processing.

### To do
- Add notes/labels.
- Crop exported image so that circuit sits in screen center.
- Change how i/o is implemented to stop unexpected behavior with code char duality.
- Center component labels.
- Make inductor symbol more fancy
- Use super sampling.
